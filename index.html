<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I am a first-year unspecificed business major studying at the University of Texas at Austin and I hope to declare Marketing as my major and Media and Entertainment Industries Studies as my minor. I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas but I hope to travel and explore the world in the near future. I love listening to music (LANY and BTS are my #1s), watching documentaries on Netflix, and hanging out (safely) with my friends! </p>

<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I can usually be found inside my room doing online shopping(thanks to COVID), working at HEB, spending too much money at Target, or visiting different coffee shops around San Antonio. My favorite foods include fruits, seaweed, soups, and all forms of carbs. I find myself to be the happiest when I am with my friends, listening to music, and traveling to new destinations.</p>
